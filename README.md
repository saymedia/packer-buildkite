packer-buildkite
================

This is an **experimental** [Packer](https://packer.io/) post-processor plugin
which will write id of an artifact into the [BuildKite](https://buildkite.com/)
job metadata store.

It is still in a prototype-ish state and has not been tested in production.
Use with caution, if at all!
