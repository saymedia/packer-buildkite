packer-buildkite
================

This is an **experimental** [Packer](https://packer.io/) post-processor plugin
which will write id of an artifact into the [BuildKite](https://buildkite.com/)
job metadata store.

It is still in a prototype-ish state and has not been tested in production.
Use with caution, if at all!

Usage
-----
Add the post-processor to your packer template:

    {
        "post-processors": [
          {
            "type": "buildkite",
            "prefix": "example_a"
          }
        ]
    }

Check out [`multi-test.json`](./multi-test.json) for an example.

Installation
------------

Run:

    $ go get github.com/saymedia/packer-post-processor-buildkite
    $ go install github.com/saymedia/packer-post-processor-buildkite

Add the post-processor to ~/.packerconfig:

    {
      "post-processors": {
        "buildkite": "packer-post-processor-buildkite"
      }
    }

Tests
-----

### STEP 0:

Install packer-post-processor-buildkite as detailed above.

### STEP 1:

Create a file called `multi-test-variables.json` with the contents similar to (use your own AWS values of course):

    {
        "AWS_VPC_ID": "vpc-2421cc41",
        "AWS_SUBNET_ID": "subnet-49f75e2c",
        "AWS_SG_ID": "sg-9a57f80a",
        "AWS_AMI_ID": "ami-cb9d728f",
        "AWS_REGION": "us-west-1"
    }

### STEP 2:

Run:
  
    $ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY='<YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY>'
    $ export AWS_SECRET_KEY='<YOUR_AWS_SECRET_KEY>'
    $ export BUILDKITE_AGENT_ACCESS_TOKEN='<YOUR_BUILDKITE_AGENT_ACCESS_TOKEN>'
    $ export BUILDKITE_JOB_ID='<YOUR_BUILDKITE_JOB_ID>'
    $ ./test.sh
